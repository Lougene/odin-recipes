This current project is my first (during The Odin Project) website. 

I've coded some HTML/CSS websites between 2017-2018 while in University. While I feel like I understand HTML and CSS I'm redoing this to ensure I haven't forgotten/missed anything. 

So far, the course has outlined HTML and CSS and some best practices.
